### Nelisa wants to limit access to her shop’s data

Now that the system is working so well and Xolani can add products, purchase and sales data to the system, Nelisa is concerned about what different people can do in the system. She wants administrators to be able to add new data and others only to access the reporting functionality in the system.

* Administrators can only use the system once they are logged in.
* Add two roles to the system - one roles for people who can only see sales reports and another role for an administrator that can do everything in the system.
* After logging in, the site should remember the person’s credentials.
